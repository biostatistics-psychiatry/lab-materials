title: "Lab: Categorial and linear predictor interactions"
---

# Scenario

Right when you are about to submit your paper for peer-review, a new collaborator joins the project. Beacuse the only way we measure contributions is by the number of comments and edits to Word-files, shortly after the collaborator joins you get the manuscript back with tons of changes. One of them reads:

"Surely there must be important interactions between the predictor variables. Please check if gender interacts with depression level."

# Analysis

Fit a model with gender, PHQ-9, and LSAS-scores as the outcome. Evaluate the interaction between gender and PHQ-9. Analyze the data and document your findings in a Quarto notebook.
