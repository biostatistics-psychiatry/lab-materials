It’s safe to store the data you are working with in this course here, however.\nR/: This folder contains the scripts you are working on.\ndocs/: This folder contains the documentation for your project. One good way to distinguish this from output is that the docs folder contains files and background information that is not generate by the code you are writing, for example documentation about questionnaires.\noutput/: This folder contains the output of your code, such as figures, tables, and reports. This is where you will save the results of your analysis.

    "text": "Centrality measures\nSometimes we need more comprehensive summaries of our data. For this purpose, it is common to use centrality measures. Centrality measures are statistical summaries that describe the center or typical value of a dataset. They help summarize where most values lie and include:\n\nMean: The average of all values (sum of all values divided by the number of values).\nMedian: The middle value when data is ordered (or the average of the two middle numbers if the length of the vector is an even number).\nMode: The most frequently occurring value.\n\nThese measures provide insight into the distribution’s central tendency, helping you understand the “typical” case in your data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeans, medians and outliers\n\n\n\nThe mean is sensitive to outliers, while the median is not. The values [1, 2, 3, 100] has a mean of 26.5. and a median of 2.5. None of them are “wrong”, but the usefulness of each measure depends on what you want your centrality measures to tell. However, with highly skewed variables (e.g. income), the median is usually viewed as more informative.\n\n\nNow let’s use R to calculate some centrality measures for LSAS at baseline.\n\nGetting the mean using mean()\n\nmean(d_bl$lsas_screen)\n\n[1] 84.75138\n\n\n\n\nGetting the median using median()\n\nmedian(d_bl$lsas_screen)\n\n[1] 82\n\n\n\n\nGetting the mode\nUnlike mean() and median(), base R does not include a built-in mode() function for computing the statistical mode (i.e. the most frequent value).

For example, the two distributions below have the same mean value (0), but different spread (standard deviation 0.2 vs. 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get a summary of the spread of the data, we use different spread measures. Spread measures describe how much the data varies or is dispersed around a central value like the mean or median. They help you understand whether the values are tightly clustered or widely scattered. Commonly used spread measures include:\n\nRange range(): The difference between the maximum and minimum values. Simple but sensitive to outliers.\n\\[\\text{Range} = \\max(X) - \\min(X)\\]\nInterquartile Range (IQR) IQR(): The range of the middle 50% of data (Q3 − Q1). More robust against extreme values.\n\\[\\mathrm{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1\\]\nVariance var(): The average of the squared deviations from the mean.

It includes a correction (called Bessel’s correction) to account for the fact that samples tend to underestimate variability. The sample SD divides by \\(n -1\\) to compensate for the fact that we use \\(\\bar{x}\\), an estimate of the true population mean (\\(\\mu\\)).

    "text": "Contingency tables and the Chi-squared test\nSay that we wanted to test the distribution of some categorical variable across two groups, the the methods presented above will not help. For this we need other tests.\nSay that we wanted to know if the gender distribution was similar across in the self-guided as in the therapist-guided treatment group of the the STEpS study. The first step to such an investigation would be to create a contingency table showing the gender distribution across the groups.\n\n# create a gender variable\ndf_data$gender &lt;- rbinom(nrow(df_data), 1, 0.7)\ndf_data$gender &lt;- ifelse(df_data$gender == 1, \"Woman\", \"Man\")\n\n\ntable(df_data$trt, df_data$gender) # number of person\n\n                  \n                   Man Woman\n  self-guided       17    44\n  therapist-guided  20    40\n  waitlist          16    44\n\nprop.table(table(df_data$trt, df_data$gender), margin = 1) # proportion in each treatment group\n\n                  \n                         Man     Woman\n  self-guided      0.2786885 0.7213115\n  therapist-guided 0.3333333 0.6666667\n  waitlist         0.2666667 0.7333333\n\n\nWe see that there are some small differences between the groups, but we have no statistical test of these differences. Say that we wanted to test the null hypothesis that there is no association between gender and the treatment group you end up in. This hypothesis should hold, due to the randomization of the STEpS study.\nOne way to test if the proportion of men and women differs between the groups is perform a Chi-squared test (\\(X^2-test\\)).\nThe formula for Chi-squared test statistic is:\n\\[\n\\chi^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{r} \\sum_{j=1}^{c} \\frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\nE_{ij} = \\frac{(\\text{row total})_i \\cdot (\\text{column total})_j}{\\text{grand total}}\n\\]\nThis test compares the observed counts in each cell against what would be expected if values where distributed equally across the groups (i.e. across the cells of the contingency table). Coding this formula manually is a bit tricky, but here is the code for those interested.\n\n## Build the contingency table\ntbl &lt;- table(trt = df_data$trt, gender = df_data$gender)\n\n## Convert this table to matrix format for the following calculations\nO &lt;- as.matrix(tbl)\nO\n\n                  gender\ntrt                Man Woman\n  self-guided       17    44\n  therapist-guided  20    40\n  waitlist          16    44\n\n## Expected counts E_ij = (row total_i * col total_j) / grand total\nrow_tot &lt;- rowSums(O)\ncol_tot &lt;- colSums(O)\ngrand &lt;- sum(O)\nE &lt;- outer(row_tot, col_tot) / grand # outer is a function to multiply arayys\nE\n\n                      Man    Woman\nself-guided      17.86188 43.13812\ntherapist-guided 17.56906 42.43094\nwaitlist         17.56906 42.43094\n\n## Chi-square statistic: sum_{i,j} (O_ij - E_ij)^2 / E_ij\nchi_sq &lt;- sum((O - E)^2 / E)\n\n## Degrees of freedom: (r - 1)(c - 1)\nr &lt;- nrow(O)\nc &lt;- ncol(O)\ndf &lt;- (r - 1) * (c - 1)\n\n## p-value from chi-square distribution\np_value &lt;- pchisq(chi_sq, df = df, lower.tail = FALSE)\np_value\n\n[1] 0.6932986\n\n\nIn R, these calculations can be easily performed using the function chisq.test() that also provide tables for the observed and expected frequencies\n\nchisq.test(df_data$trt, df_data$gender)\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  df_data$trt and df_data$gender\nX-squared = 0.73259, df = 2, p-value = 0.6933\n\nchisq.test(df_data$trt, df_data$gender)$observed\n\n                  df_data$gender\ndf_data$trt        Man Woman\n  self-guided       17    44\n  therapist-guided  20    40\n  waitlist          16    44\n\nchisq.test(df_data$trt, df_data$gender)$expected\n\n                  df_data$gender\ndf_data$trt             Man    Woman\n  self-guided      17.86188 43.13812\n  therapist-guided 17.56906 42.43094\n  waitlist         17.56906 42.43094\n\n\nOur results tells us that the null hypothesis of no association cannot be rejected. In other words, our data would not be unexpected if there was no association between gender and treatment group in the underlying population (kind of a strange though experiment, as there are only treatment variables in treatment studies, not in the underlying population).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThe Chi-squared test is only valid if the counts in each cell is &gt;5. When cell counts are lower, Fisher’s exact test should be used instead. You can use the fisher.test() function\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Testing categorical distributions\n\n\n\nChi-squared tests, and other tests of significance, are sometimes used to check that important pre-treatment characteristics, such as gender or symptom level, are balanced between the treatment groups. Non-sinificant p-values are then taken as an argument that the groups are balanced. Reason about why this is a problematic approach.\nCreate a categorical for high or low generalized anxiety and one for high and low social anxiety, and use the Chi squared test to test the null hypothesis of no association between the variables",

We won’t go through the formulas for all these, but show you how they can be implemented in R.\n\nSign test\nThe sign test is used to test whether the median of paired differences equals a hypothesized value (often 0), using only the signs of differences, (i.e. + or -). This test can be used even when the sample is small, and the underlying population distribution is assumed to be non-normal.\nThe test is performed by counting how often a difference between pairs of values are positive. If there was no systematic change, this should occur 50% of the time. We then test whether our actual proportion of positive signs is likely to come from an underlying population where 50% of the signs are positive.\nWe could use it to test the nyll hypothesis that the median difference of LSAS-score at between pre-treatment and post-treatment is 0 (analog to our paired t-test above).\n\n# Paired sign test: H0 median LSAS(pre - post) = 0\ndiff_pre_post &lt;- df_data$lsas_post - df_data$lsas_screen # create differnece scores\nn &lt;- sum(diff_pre_post != 0, na.rm = TRUE) # exclude ties (exact zeros)\ns &lt;- sum(diff_pre_post[diff_pre_post != 0] &gt; 0, na.rm = TRUE) # number of positive differences (again excluding ties)\nbinom.test(s, n, p = 0.5, alternative = \"two.sided\") # a test of the proportion\n\n\n    Exact binomial test\n\ndata:  s and n\nnumber of successes = 24, number of trials = 167, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.0943006 0.2062463\nsample estimates:\nprobability of success \n             0.1437126 \n\n\nThis null hypothesis seems very unlikely.\n\n\nWilcoxon signed rank test\nTests if the distribution of paired differences is symmetric around 0 (often framed as median difference = 0), using magnitudes and signs.\n\nAssumptions: Paired observations; differences are symmetrically distributed.\nPro’s: Unlike the t-test, it does not assume interval level data. It is also better powered that the sign test.\nWe can use this to test the null hypothesis that the median LSAS score is the same at post-treatment as at pre-treatment.\n\nwilcox.test(df_data$lsas_post, df_data$lsas_screen,\n  paired = TRUE,\n  alternative = \"two.sided\",\n  exact = FALSE\n)\n\n\n    Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction\n\ndata:  df_data$lsas_post and df_data$lsas_screen\nV = 1310, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0\n\n\nAgain, the null hypothesis seems very unlikely.\n\n\nWilcox rank-sum test\nThis test, aslo known as the Mann-Whitney U-test, test whether two independent samples come from the same distribution (often interpreted as a shift in location/medians).\n\nAssumptions: Independent samples; similar shapes are helpful for a “median shift” interpretation.\nUnlike the independent groups t-test, it does not assume interval level data. We can use this test to test the null hypothesis that LSAS scores at post-treatment have the same distribution in the self-guided and the therapist-guided treatment groups.\n\n# Two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test (unpaired)\n\nwilcox.test(lsas_post ~ trt,\n  data = df_data,\n  subset = trt %in% c(\"self-guided\", \"therapist-guided\"),\n  exact = FALSE\n)\n\n\n    Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction\n\ndata:  lsas_post by trt\nW = 1872, p-value = 0.04974\nalternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Non-parametric tests\n\n\n\nWhich of all the test performed today do you think is most appropriate for the pre-post difference in LSAS scores?\nAnd which of all tests performed is most appropriate for comparing the LSAS scores between the self-guided and the therapist-guided groups?\nPerform a signed test for the pre-post difference in DERS scores and interpret the results.",

    "text": "Load packages and data\n\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nd_bl &lt;- read_rds(here(\"data\", \"steps_baseline.rds\"))\n\nThe law of large numbers brings us to the concept of probability. In frequentist statistics, probability is defined as the long run frequency of an event as the number of events approach infinity, \\(\\infty\\). For instance the proportion of heads in an infinite number of coin tosses will approach 0.5.\n\n\nP-values\nProbability - defined as the long-run frequency of an event occurring - is very much used in research to get an idea of how probable our observed data is, given some hypothesis of interest. In probability notation \\(P(Data|Hypothesis)\\).\nFor instance we might have an hypothesis the the mean of LSAS-SR is 82 in the population. We can determine how probable our data would be under this hypothesis, by investigating how often we would expect to get our observed sample mean if this (null)hypothesis was true.\nFor this we would need the sampling distribution of mean LSAS-SR scores in samples of 181 people (the size, \\(n\\), of our sample), if the true population mean was 82. One way to get this would be to simulate say 10 000 samples of LSAS-SR scores, from a population with a true mean of 82. To simulate this, we also need to know the spread (standard deviation) of the true population. We don’t know this, but let’s assume it is the same as in our sample.\nBelow, the function rnorm() is used to take a random sample of 181 values from a normal distribution with a mean of 82 and a standard deviation 16.5 (same as in out sample). We use a for loop to repeat this sampling 10 000 times and save the mean values of each sample in the vector called means.\n\nn_samples &lt;- 1e4 # the number of samples\nsmp_size &lt;- 181 # the size of our samples\nmeans &lt;- rep(NA, n_samples) # an empty vector to contain our mean values\n\nfor (i in 1:n_samples) {\n  x &lt;- rnorm(smp_size, mean = 82, sd = sd(d_bl$lsas_screen))\n  means[i] &lt;- mean(x)\n}\n\nhist(means, main = \"Simulated sampling distribution of LSAS means\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use this simulated sampling distribution to see how probable our observed LSAS-SR mean is if the (null)hypothesis that the true mean is 82 would be correct. First let plot the sampling distribution again, and show the observed LSAS-SR mean as a vertical line.\n\nhist(means, main = \"Simulated sampling distribution of LSAS means\")\nabline(v = mean(d_bl$lsas_screen), col = \"red\", lwd = 2, lty = 2) # vertical line showing the observed LSAS-SR mean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also quantify the probability by calculating, the proportion of times that a sample mean would be equal to or greater that our observed mean, IF the true population mean was 82. This quantity is the very (in)famous p-value.\n\nmean(means &gt;= mean(d_bl$lsas_screen)) # proportion of simulated means that are larger than our observed mean\n\n[1] 0.0129\n\n\nIf we find this simulation exercise a bit tedious, we could also use theoretical distributions for the sample means to calculate our p-value. The t-distribution can be used to estimate the spread to the sample means when the population variance is unknown and the sample variance is used to approximate it. It is very similar to the normal distribution, but has heavier tails that accounts for the uncertainty produced by using the sample variance instead of the true population variance when estimating the standard error of the sampling distribution. However, when the sample size increase, the t-distribution will come closer and closer to a normal distribution (also known as a z-distribution when standardized to have mean=0 and sd=1).\n\n# Set up the plot range\nx_range &lt;- seq(-4, 4, length = 500)\n\n# Plot standard normal distribution\nplot(x_range, dnorm(x_range),\n  type = \"l\", lwd = 2, col = \"black\",\n  ylab = \"Density\", xlab = \"x\", main = \"t-Distribution vs Normal Distribution\"\n)\n\n# Add t-distributions with different degrees of freedom\nlines(x_range, dt(x_range, df = 1), col = \"red\", lwd = 2, lty = 2)\nlines(x_range, dt(x_range, df = 5), col = \"blue\", lwd = 2, lty = 3)\nlines(x_range, dt(x_range, df = 15), col = \"darkgreen\", lwd = 2, lty = 4)\nlines(x_range, dt(x_range, df = 30), col = \"purple\", lwd = 2, lty = 5)\n\n# Add a legend\nlegend(\"topright\",\n  legend = c(\"Normal (Z)\", \"t (df=1)\", \"t (df=5)\", \"t (df=15)\", \"t (df=30)\"),\n  col = c(\"black\", \"red\", \"blue\", \"darkgreen\", \"purple\"),\n  lwd = 2, lty = 1:5, bty = \"n\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe probability of getting a a sample mean that is greater or equal to our observed mean can be calculated by transforming our observed mean to a t-value and compare it to the t-distribution.\nThe t-value of our mean \\(\\bar{x}\\) under the null hypothesis that the population mean is \\(\\mu\\), is given by the formula:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{SE}\n\\]\nReplacing these greek letters with our actual values \\(\\bar{x} = 84.75\\), \\(\\mu = 82\\), and \\(SE=1.22\\), we get:\n\nse &lt;- sd(d_bl$lsas_screen) / sqrt(nrow(d_bl))\nx_bar &lt;- mean(d_bl$lsas_screen)\nt_value &lt;- (x_bar - 82) / se\nt_value\n\n[1] 2.24774\n\n\nNow let’s see the probability of getting a value larger or equal to this - our one-sided p-value! For this we use the pt() function, that provides the cumulative probability up until a given t-value. 1 minus this cumulative probability gives the probability of values equal or above the given t-value.\n\n1 - pt(t_value, df = 180)\n\n[1] 0.01290324\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nz-values and t-values\n\n\n\nWhen the sample size increases, the t-distribution approaches the z-distribution and these estimates become very similar. As a general rule of thumb, it is fine to use z-values rather than t-values for sample sizes larger than 200.\n\n\nWe could also get a very similar p-value from the z-distribution (although we would assume we have the population variance for out calculation of the standard error). If this was a proportion, a z-test would be the one to use, since we are not using any estimates when calculating the standard error.\n\n1 - pnorm(t_value)\n\n[1] 0.01229639\n\n\nVery similar to our simulated p-value above! More conveniently, of course, we could get this p-value using the t.test() function.\n\nt.test(d_bl$lsas_screen, mu = 82, alternative = \"greater\")\n\n\n    One Sample t-test\n\ndata:  d_bl$lsas_screen\nt = 2.2477, df = 180, p-value = 0.0129\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is greater than 82\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 82.72756      Inf\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n 84.75138 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne-sided and two-sided p-values\n\n\n\nWhat we have calculated, bow in three different ways, is the one-sided p-value. This is because we only looked at the probability to get data equal to or greater than our observed data, given that the null-hypothesis was true.\nIf we wanted to see the probability of getting data equal or greater than our observed data OR equal or less than out observed data under the null-hypothesis, we would want a two-sided p-value. Since the sampling distribution is symmetrical, we could get this by multiplying of one-sided p-value by 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode for the two-sided p-value\n\n# manual code\nse &lt;- sd(d_bl$lsas_screen) / sqrt(nrow(d_bl))\nx_bar &lt;- mean(d_bl$lsas_screen)\nt_value &lt;- (x_bar - 82) / se\n(1 - pt(t_value, df = 180)) * 2\n\n[1] 0.02580648\n\n# or using the t-test function\nt.test(d_bl$lsas_screen, mu = 82, alternative = \"two.sided\")\n\n\n    One Sample t-test\n\ndata:  d_bl$lsas_screen\nt = 2.2477, df = 180, p-value = 0.02581\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 82\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 82.33602 87.16675\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n 84.75138 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: P-value for PHQ-9 Mean\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the p-value for the null hypothesis that the mean PHQ-9 value in the underlying population is 9, and describe in words what this number means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: P-value for Proportion of Men\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the p-value for getting our observed proportion of men, \\(\\hat{p}\\), if the true population proportion, \\(p\\), was 50% or more using a z-test.\nHINT: use the standard error of the proportion: \\[\n\\mathrm{SE}(p) = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1 - p)}{n}}\n\\]\nand combine with the formula for the z-scores\n\\[\nz= \\frac{p - \\hat{p}}{SE}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Effect of Sample Size on P-value\n\n\n\n\n\nModify the simulation code for the sampling distribution above to determine what would happen to the p-value if the sample size was 10, 100 or 1000.\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidence intervals\nUsing the standard error, we can also calculate the confidence interval, defined as an interval that, if computed on a repeated set of samples, would contain the true population statistic 95% of the times.\nWhen the sample standard deviation is used, we get the confidence intervals by taking the observed mean and adding or subtracting the t-value of the desired percentiles of the sampling distribution (indicated by the asterix) times the standard error.\n\\[ \\text{CI} = \\bar{x} \\pm t^*\\ \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\]\nIf we knew the stardard error of the population, we could substitute the sample variance \\(s\\) for the population variance \\(\\sigma\\), and use z-values instead of t-values. For 95% confidence intervals, the z-value is 1.96.\n\\[\n\\text{CI} = \\bar{x} \\pm z^*\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\n\\]\nFor a proportion, the confidence intervals becomes:\n\\[\n\\hat{p} \\pm z^* \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidence intervals for proportions\n\n\n\n\n\nThis confidence intervals for proportion, known as Wald confidence intervals, is easy to compute. However, since it uses the sample proportion to estimate the population proportion, they can be erratic, especially when \\(\\hat{p}\\) approach 0 or 1. We therefore recommend using more advanced confidence intervals, calculated by statistical software, for instance using the function prop.test().\n\n\n\nNow let’s use these formulas to calculate the confidence interval of the mean of LSAS-SR\n\nt_value &lt;- qt(1 - 0.025, 180) # the t-value for a 95% confidence interval with 180 degrees of freedom\n\nse &lt;- sd(d_bl$lsas_screen) / sqrt(nrow(d_bl)) # standard error of LSAS-SR\n\nucl &lt;- mean(d_bl$lsas_screen) + t_value * se # the upper confidence limit\nlcl &lt;- mean(d_bl$lsas_screen) - t_value * se # the lower confidence limit\n\nprint(c(lcl, ucl))\n\n[1] 82.33602 87.16675\n\n\nWe can also use the t.test() function to get this interval\n\nt.test(d_bl$lsas_screen, conf.level = 0.95) # For a 95% CI\n\n\n    One Sample t-test\n\ndata:  d_bl$lsas_screen\nt = 69.238, df = 180, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 82.33602 87.16675\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n 84.75138 \n\n\nLet’s also see what happens if we use z-values (for 95% confidence intervals, the z-value is approx 1.96)\n\nse &lt;- sd(d_bl$lsas_screen) / sqrt(nrow(d_bl)) # standard error of LSAS-SR\n\nucl &lt;- mean(d_bl$lsas_screen) + 1.96 * se\nlcl &lt;- mean(d_bl$lsas_screen) - 1.96 * se\n\nprint(c(lcl, ucl))\n\n[1] 82.35221 87.15055\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Z-scores vs T-scores for Confidence Intervals\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain why the confidence intervals calculated using z-scores are narrower than the ones using t-scores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: 95% Confidence Interval for PHQ-9\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the 95% confidence interval for PHQ-9, and describe in words what these numbers mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Wald Confidence Interval for Proportion of Men\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the 95% Wald confidence interval for the proportion of men in the dataset using the formula above and interpret its meaning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Comparing Wald vs prop.test() Confidence Intervals\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare this to what you would obtain using the function prop.test() in R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Interpreting Confidence Intervals in Context\n\n\n\n\n\nReason about the meaning and interpretation of the confidence intervals you have calculated in the context of how the actual STePs study was performed.

Non-sinificant p-values are then taken as an argument that the groups are balanced. Reason about why this is a problematic approach.\nAnswer: Because a non-significant result is not evidence of no difference. With small samples, even large differences may be non-significant. Conversely, in large samples even the smallest difference may be statistically significant.\nCreate a categorical for high or low generalized anxiety and one for high and low social anxiety, and use the Chi squared test to test the null hypothesis of no association between the variables\n\ndf_data &lt;- df_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    gad_cat_screen = if_else(\n      gad_screen &gt; median(gad_screen),\n      \"High GAD\", \"Low GAD\"\n    ),\n    sad_cat_screen = if_else(\n      lsas_screen &gt; median(lsas_screen),\n      \"High SAD\", \"Low SAD\"\n    )\n  )\n\nchisq.test(df_data$gad_cat_screen, df_data$sad_cat_screen)\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction\n\ndata:  df_data$gad_cat_screen and df_data$sad_cat_screen\nX-squared = 2.4198, df = 1, p-value = 0.1198\n\nchisq.test(df_data$gad_cat_screen, df_data$sad_cat_screen)$observed\n\n                      df_data$sad_cat_screen\ndf_data$gad_cat_screen High SAD Low SAD\n              High GAD       49      39\n              Low GAD        40      53\n\nchisq.test(df_data$gad_cat_screen, df_data$sad_cat_screen)$expected\n\n                      df_data$sad_cat_screen\ndf_data$gad_cat_screen High SAD  Low SAD\n              High GAD 43.27072 44.72928\n              Low GAD  45.72928 47.27072"
